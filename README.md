# 2L-FUSE

# Brief Description 

This code proposes sparsity enhancement in kernel-based models which, as first step, involves learning a data-adaptive kernel metric, i.e. a shape matrix, rather than relying on a fixed shape parameter. An eigen-decomposition is performed to the shape matrix which defines the optimal metric. This decomposition enables a Feature Understanding and Sparsity Enhancement via 2-Layered kernel machines (2L-FUSE).
